        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>
          This project addresses the critical challenge of ensuring global food security in the face of climate change. As part of a Kaggle competition, I developed and evaluated a suite of machine learning models—including **Random Forest, XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**—to predict future crop viability. By integrating historical climate data, soil properties, and crop yield records, the models learned to forecast yields for wheat and maize. The analysis identified key environmental drivers, such as **soil nitrogen and short-wave radiation**, and provided a scalable framework for adapting agricultural strategies to climate uncertainty.

        <h3>The Business Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Climate change poses a significant risk to global agriculture through shifting weather patterns and extreme events. For governments, agricultural organizations, and farmers, the ability to accurately forecast crop yields under future climate scenarios is essential for strategic planning, resource allocation, and mitigating food shortages. This project aimed to answer the question: **Can we build reliable machine learning models to predict how crop yields will change in different locations over time?** The goal was to create a data-driven tool that could help stakeholders make proactive decisions to ensure a stable and secure food supply.

        <h3>Key Code Snippets</h3>
        <p>The project compared traditional machine learning with deep learning for time-series forecasting. The following snippets represent the core modeling techniques used.</p>
        
        <h4>1. Training a Gradient Boosting Model (XGBoost)</h4>
        <p>XGBoost, a powerful tree-based model, was used for its high performance and interpretability on the tabular dataset of static and aggregated climate features.</p>
        <div class="code-container">
          <pre><code><span class="token keyword">import</span> xgboost <span class="token keyword">as</span> xgb

<span class="token comment"># Initialize and train the XGBoost Regressor model</span>
xgbr = xgb.XGBRegressor(objective=<span class="token string">'reg:squarederror'</span>,
                          n_estimators=<span class="token number">1000</span>,

<span class="token comment"># Make predictions on the test set</span>
y_pred = xgbr.predict(X_test)</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h4>2. Building a Time-Series Model (LSTM)</h4>
        <p>An LSTM network was developed to capture temporal dependencies in the sequential climate data (e.g., daily temperature and precipitation). This deep learning approach is ideal for learning from time-series patterns.</p>

    LSTM(units=<span class="token number">64</span>, return_sequences=<span class="token boolean">True</span>),

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Feature Engineering vs. Raw Data:</strong> A key challenge was determining the right level of feature engineering. While initial intuition suggested creating abstract features (e.g., "heat stress days"), the final analysis showed that the LSTM model performed significantly better when fed the raw, high-resolution climate data directly, allowing it to learn more complex temporal patterns on its own.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Fusion:</strong> The project required integrating two distinct types of data: static, location-based soil data and dynamic, time-series climate data. Developing a model architecture that could effectively combine these different data structures was a significant technical challenge.</li>
          <li><strong>Model Selection and Interpretability:</strong> A major part of the project involved comparing the performance of traditional models (Random Forest, XGBoost) against a deep learning model (LSTM). While the LSTM ultimately performed well, the tree-based models provided greater interpretability, offering clearer insights into which specific features were the most important predictors of crop yield.</li>
